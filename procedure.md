1. Select a molecule from the list in the simulation.
2. Dihedral angle vs Energy plot of the selected molecule will get displayed.
3. Select any point on this graph.
4. Now select a large step size from the slider.
5. Click on Get Next Point to get next lower point using steepest descent method.
6. For the current selected angle, the orientation of the molecule will also get displayed.
7. Use mouse/touch to interact with molecule, by rotating, and zooming around it.
8. Perform the above mentioned steps repeatedly, by gradually reducing the step size, until minima is reached.
