 Step by step details of the experiment:

1. From the main page choose one of the optimization methods.
2. Now select one of the displayed molecules for geometric optimization.
3. In the first stage of optimization, the algorithm is ''constructed'' by clicking on the appropriate buttons at the bottom left of the screen.
4. In the second stage, the values for various parameters are set:
   a. Choose the position by clicking the "Choose X" and then pointing and clicking on the graph where the point is to be located.
   b. Variables like "Step Size" can be changed within the preset range of values by repeatedly clicking its button.
   c. By clicking the ''Repeat'' button, one iteration is performed. The new position and the structure that corresponds to it are displayed.
5. Please note the value of the minima that you have obtained.
