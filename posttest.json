      "question": "Which of the following will have the highest time period of oscillation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "C-H",
        "b": "C-C",
        "c": "C-O",
        "d": "C-Cl"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "Time period depends upon the reduced mass of the atoms involved in the vibrational mode. Higher the reduced mass, higher is the time period. C-Cl has the highest reduced mass among all. "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },

      "question": "Which of the following will have the slowest time period of oscillation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "C-C",
        "b": "C=C",
        "c": "Câ‰¡C",
        "d": "All will have the same time period"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Time period of an oscillation depends on the force constant of the bond involved. Force constant is higher for bonds having multiple bonds than those having single bonds. "

      "question": "Choose the correct statement from the following",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is not possible to reach a higher energy stationary state using geometry optimization",
        "b": "It is possible to reach a higher energy stationary state using geometry optimization",
        "c": "Geometry optimization can take any structure to both high and low energy stationary states",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Geometry optimization can take a structure to high and low energy stationary state depending on the requirement of the calculations, provided the structure is closer to expected stationary state."
